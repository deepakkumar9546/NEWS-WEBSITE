# NEWS-WEBSITE

Developed a dynamic web application using JavaScript to fetch and display news articles from the News API based on user queries and predefined categories. Implemented asynchronous functions to handle API requests efficiently and created a template-based system to dynamically generate news cards, displaying article images, titles, sources and descriptions. This project highlights my proficiency in JavaScript, API integration, and building interactive web applications with real-time content updates.
